Please find below response from our CBS vendor:

“please note the reason for delay is before the finish of first request , you are initiating the second request on the same account which results in account lock. Lock on STTM_CUST_ACCOUNT is observed in the AWR reports as well

Lock/Could not update account is expected behaviour if request ( accounting ) happens simultaneously. This is required to maintain account balance integrity and cannot compromise.

Once the lock happens, system tries it 49 times to post the transaction which is having cascading effect on your other sessions thus increasing your response from 1-2 seconds to 15-20 seconds.

To avoid this , you can send API request serially(post completion of previous) and this should be controlled by your external system.”
